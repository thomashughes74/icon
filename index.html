<p> When the pandemic hit, US sports were heavily affected. Participation rates declined sharply, especially in team sports. Bicycling, which was the most popular sporting activity among kids ages 6-17 before the pandemic hit, largely kept its participants active. But other sports, like basketball, baseball, and soccer, saw participation rates of active players go down by about half. This means that players who normally spent an hour playing their given sport played only a half hour during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The 2020 survey was conducted by the Aspen Institute in conjunction with Utah State University. The benefits of sports on mental helath, especially among youth, have been documented in studies including a 2019 study published in the academic journal, "journal of sports." Its author, Chandrakanta Hiremath, writes, "youth who actively involved themselves in sports both middle & high school showed more positive  attitude  towards  life  when  compared  to  non-sport participants which means that less of suicidal ideation among sports  participants (Taliaferro et al., 2011)."</p>

            <div class= "container">
<p> Before the pandemic hit, biking had the highest participation rates among youth sports, of 9.2 million kids. While not always organized, biking was the activity that most children ages 6-17 engaged in on a weekly basis. Biking rates declined the least during the pandemic, with bicyclists riding for 9.1 hours during the week, compared to 10.5 before.</p>

            <div class= "container">
<p>With about 7.5 million participants, basketball was the most popular team sport among youth participants in 2019. Many gyms were closed during the pandemic and some programs cancelled. In New York City, rims were even taken off of public courts early in the pandemic to discourage gathering and playing. By Sept. 2020, participants reported playing about 7.9 hours per week, compared to 14 hours before the nationwide shutdowns.
